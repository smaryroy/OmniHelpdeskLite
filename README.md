## Bootcamp Final Project


As a developer, I’ve often had to wear many hats. One of these roles was that of IT Helpdesk Support.  Over the years, I have worked with several different ticket tracking applications and found all of them to have both good and bad features. Maybe someday I can build something with all of the good and none of the bad?

Omni Helpdesk Light is a simple and lightweight ticket tracking app that incorporates a few of my favorite features. The initial goal is to provide a clear, intuitive user interface and make tracking and managing support request tickets simple.

## User Story
AS A small business owner or helpdesk technician

I WANT to be able to manage helpdesk requests in a simple and intuitive way

SO THAT I can prioritize and focus on tasks
